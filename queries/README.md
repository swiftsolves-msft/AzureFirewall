# Query for IDPS Signatures in Network Firewall Logs

Azure Firewall Premium brings IDPS capabilities including logging IDPS Signatures when an alert or deny occurs due to IDPS.

## How it Works
Use this query to discover the Signature which can be used to bypass the default behaviour of IDPS per Signature.

```
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15m)
| where Category == "AzureFirewallNetworkRule"
| where OperationName == "AzureFirewallIDSLog"
| parse msg_s with * "TCP request from " Source " to " Destination ". Action: " ActionTaken ". Rule: " IDPSSig ". IDS: " IDSMessage ". Priority: " Priority ". Classification: " Classification
| project TimeGenerated, Source, Destination, ActionTaken, IDPSSig, IDSMessage, Priority, Classification
```
